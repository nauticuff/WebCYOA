        There Malenia stood, looking super epic, causing many gamers many many nightmares.. She only had one thing on
        her mind, beating Radagon and the Elden Beast.
        She knew it wouldn't be an easy fight, she would have to train her camera every day for weeks and months and
        months, but she knew it wouldn't be enough.
        She would need a comepletly OP build in order to win this fight. Would you like to travel the Lands Between
        while building your strength or dexterity?
