    You choose to kill all the bosses before facing the Elden Beast. It is a slow and tedious process but you manage to get it done through the course of many weeks. As you stand before this goliath you feel a rush of adrenaline course through you. You are scared yes, but also condident in your ablities. Faced with the final boss you lunge and swipe. You one tap it. Nice.
